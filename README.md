## Getting And Cleaning Data
JHU Data Science Specialization - Course 3 Project
Author - Kevin M. Beauchemin, MPP

### Purpose
This project contains a single .R file titled run_analysis.R. It utilizes
experimental data from UCI titled "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set".
The experiments utilized smartphone accelerometer data from 30 volunteers as they
performed a series of activities. Further data set information can be found at
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

### run_analysis.R
This file contains the core function to accomplish the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the
   average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
